To build hebcal from the source repository, you'll need a few more
tools than are needed in order to build from distributions.   In
particular, you'll need

GNU autoconf version 2.59
GNU automake version 1.9.5  or later
GNU m4 version 1.4.3 or later
GNU make v3.79 or later
Perl v5.0 or later

Once you have those, you can prepare the build environment as follows:

aclocal && autoconf && automake --foreign --add-missing && ./configure && make

If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, please feel free to
post them in the hebcal project trackers at
https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal/issues or contact Danny Sadinoff
directly at hebcal@sadinoff.com
