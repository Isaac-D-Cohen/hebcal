* The day of the week
* The days of the Omer

   If you are going to use this program, please drop me a line.
   I'd like to know who you are, what version you're using, and how
   you're using hebcal, and anything else you'd like to tell me, so
   that I can adjust the program to meet users' needs.

   I am NOT demanding payment for the use of my program, but writing
   this program DID take time.  The "free" in the GNU public license
   refers to distribution, not necessarily payment. Feel free to send

   address (email me for it).
