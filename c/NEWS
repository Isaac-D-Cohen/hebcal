Changes in 3.12
* When the actual date of Yom Hashoah falls on a Friday, the state of
  Israel observes Yom Hashoah on the preceding Thursday. When it falls
  on a Sunday, Yom Hashoah is observed on the following Monday.

Changes in 3.11
* If a yahrzeit would fall on 30 Cheshvan in a short year, advance
  observance to 1 Kislev. If a yahrzeit would fall on Kislev 30 in a
  short year, advance observance to 1 Tevet.
* Allow Ta'anit Bechorot (Fast of the Firstborn) to fall on a
  Friday. When a fast day falls on Friday, we do in fact observe the
  fast on Friday, even though Shabbat follows immediately. Also, in some
  years, Asarah Betevet (Tenth of Tevet) falls on Friday and is observed
  on that day.
  It is only in years when the date of the fast falls on Shabbat that
  the fast is moved: Ta'anit Ester (Fast of Esther) and Ta'anit Bekhorim
  are moved back to Thursday. Tsom Gedalyah (Fast of Gedaliah) and
  Shiv'ah Asar Betammuz (Seventeeth of Tammuz) are moved ahead to
  Sunday. Tish'ah Be'av (Ninth of Av), a full-day fast, is moved ahead
  to Saturday night. Asarah Betevet does not fall on Shabbat.

changes in 3.5
*  Added 2007 DST rule, assuming that PL 109-58 will go into effect:
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1427033&group_id=340&atid=100340

 In 2005 the 109th Congress enacted P.L. 109-58, the Energy Policy Act
 of 2005.  Section 110 of this Act amends the Uniform Time Act,
 changing the beginning of DST to the second Sunday in March and the
 ending of DST to the first Sunday in November.  This change will take
 effect in March of 2007. The Act requires the Secretary of Commerce to
 report to Congress within nine months of this date on the impact of
 this section on energy consumption in the United States. Congress
 retains the right to revert the Daylight Saving Time back to the 2005
 time schedules once the Department study is complete.

KNOWN ISSUES in 3.5:
* Triple-Purim not properly represented
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1165732&group_id=340&atid=100340
  In years where 15 Adar falls on Saturday, the observances of Shushan purim are 
  distributed over Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  This is not represented, and Shushan
  Purim is indicated as falling on Sunday.  The megilah is read on Friday 
  in Jerusalem.

* Incorrect weekly sedra displayed near Rosh Hashana
