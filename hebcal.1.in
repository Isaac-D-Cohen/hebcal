.SH DESCRIPTION
With no arguments,
.B hebcal
will print to stdout the
dates of the Jewish holidays in the current
secular year.
Each line is prefixed with a Gregorian date of the form
mm/dd/yyyy.
.PP
By specifying
.I month,
.I day,
or
.I year,
output can be limited to a particular month or date
in a particular year.  Note that
.I year
is usually a four-digit integer,
so 92 is during the Roman period,
not the late twentieth century.
If the Hebrew dates option (\fB\-H\fP) is turned on,
this number represents the Jewish calendar year.
.I month
is a number from 1..12, or the name of a Jewish calendar month.
.I day
is a number from 1..31.
.PP
For example, the command
.nf
.sp 0.6v
	hebcal 10 1992
.sp 0.6v
.fi
will print out the holidays occurring in October of 1992 C.E., while
the command
.nf
.sp 0.6v
	hebcal Tish 5752
.sp 0.6v
.fi
will print dates of interest in the month of Tishrei in Jewish
calendar year 5752.
.PP
Note:
hebcal 92 is
.I not
the same as hebcal 1992.  The year is assumed to be complete, so the
former calendar precedes the latter by nineteen centuries.
.PP
A few other bells and whistles include the weekly
.I sedra
as well as the day of the week, the count of the
.I omer,
and the Hebrew date.
.PP
Output from hebcal can be used to drive calendar(1).
Day-to-day use for hebcal is provided for in the
.B \-T
and \c
.B \-t
switches, which print out Jewish calendar entries for the current
date.
.PP
To get a quick-reference online help, run
.nf
.sp 0.6v
	hebcal help
.sp 0.6v
.fi
at the command prompt.
.sp 0.5v
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-8"
Use UTF-8 Hebrew (alias for --lang=he).
.TP
.B "\-a"
Use Ashkenazi Hebrew transliterations.
.TP
.BI "\-b " mins
Set candle-lighting to occur
.I mins
minutes before sundown.
Default 18 if unspecified (default 40 for Jerusalem, 30 for Haifa,
30 for Zichron Ya'akov).
.TP
.B "\-c"
Add \c
.I approximate \c
candle-lighting times.  See below.
.TP
.B "\--chag-only"
Output only Chag and Erev Chag events (when melakha/labor is prohibited)
.TP
.BI "\-C " city
Set latitude, longitude, and timezone according to
.IR city .
This option implies the \fB\-c\fP option.
.TP
.B "\-d"
Print the Hebrew date for the entire date range.
.TP
.B "\-D"
Print the Hebrew date for dates with some events
.TP
.B "\-e"
Change the output format to European\-style dates: dd.mm.yyyy
.TP
.B "\-E"
Output 24-hour times (e.g., 18:37 instead of 6:37)
.TP
.B "\-F"
Output the Daf Yomi for the entire date range
.TP
.B "\-g"
Emit ISO-8601 dates, i.e. YYYY-MM-DD
.TP
.BI "\-G " "degrees"
Set Havdalah to occur this many degrees below the horizon.
Use 8.5 for three small stars or 7.0833 for three
medium-sized stars.
.TP
.BI "\-\-geo " "latitude\fB,\^\fPlongitude"
Set location for solar calculations to decimal values \c
.I latitude \c
and \c
.I longitude.
Requires
.B -z
.I timzeone
switch. This switch is preferred over the
legacy \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP switches as it offers more
precision and follows the standard of negative longitudes being
.I west
of the Prime Meridian.
.TP
.B "\-h"
Suppress holidays in output.
User-defined calendar events are
unaffected by this switch.
.TP
.B "\-H"
When the \fB\-H\fP switch is used, all dates specified on the command line
are assumed to be Hebrew dates.
So for instance,
.sp 0.6v
\	example% hebcal \-H 5754
.sp 0.6v
will print data for 5754, starting in Tishrei, and ending in Elul.
Hebcal is smart enough to detect a Hebrew month and infer that you
want a Hebrew date range, so you could type
.sp 0.6v
\	example% hebcal tish 5754
.sp 0.6v
The \fB\-H\fP switch would be superfluous in this case.
Invoking hebcal with
just the \fB\-H\fP switch by itself will print data for the current Hebrew
year, starting in Tishrei.
.TP
.B "\-i"
Use Israeli holiday and sedra schedule.
Defaults to Diaspora if unspecified.
.TP
.BI "\-I " "file"
Read extra events from \c
.I "file."
These events are printed regardless of the \c
.B \-h \c
suppress holidays switch.
.sp 0.6v
There is one holiday per line in
.BI file,
each with the format
.sp 0.6v
\	\fIMMMM DD description\fP
.sp 0.6v
where \c
.I MMMM \c
is a string identifying the Jewish month in question \c
.I DD \c
is a number from 1 to 30, and \c
.I description
is a newline-terminated string describing the holiday.
An example might be
.sp 0.6v
\	Adar 1 Start cleaning kitchen for Passover
.TP
.BI "\-l " "deg\fB,\^\fPmin"
Set the latitude for solar calculations to \c
.I deg \c
degrees and \c
.I min
minutes.
Negative values are south.
.TP
.BI "\-L " "deg\fB,\^\fPmin"
Set the longitude for solar calculations to \c
.I deg \c
degrees and \c
.I min \c
minutes.
Note:
Negative values are
.B east.

strings.  Instead of saying \&\|\(lq\ 13th day of the omer \&\|\(rq
hebcal will say \&\|\(lq\ Omer: 13 \&\|\(rq
.TP
.B "\-s"
Add the weekly
.I sedra
to the output on Saturdays.  See \c
.B \-i.
.TP

.I sedra
to the output every day.  When this option is invoked, every time a
day is printed, the torah reading for the Saturday on or immediately
following that date is printed.  If there is no reading for the next
Saturday, then nothing is printed.  See
.B \-i.
.TP
.B "\-\-schottenstein"
Use Schottenstein edition of Yerushalmi Yomi (default Vilna page
numbers).
This option implies the \fB\-\-yerushalmi\fP option.

.SH "CANDLE\-LIGHTING TIMES"
Hebcal's candlelighting times are only approximations.
If you ever have any doubts about its times,
consult
your local halachic authority.  If you enter geographic
coordinates above the arctic circle or below the antarctic circle,
the times are guaranteed to be wrong.
.PP
In addition to candle-lighting on Erev Shabbat and Chag, the
\fB\-c\fP switch also generates Havdalah and fast start/end times.
.PP
By default, candle-lighting times are 18 minutes before sunset
(see \fB\-b\fP option above for exceptions).
.PP
Chanukah candle-lighting times are at civil dusk (solar depression
of 6 degrees) on weekdays. Chanukah candles are lit just before
Shabbat candles on Friday, and immediately after Havdalah on
Saturday night.
.PP
Havdalah time defaults to 72 minutes after sunset (Rabbeinu Tam).
Adjust with the \fB\-m\fP (minutes) option or with \fB\-G\fP
(havdalah degrees below horizon).
.PP
Minor fasts begin in the morning at
.I alot haShachar
(solar depression 16.1 degrees) and conclude at
.I tzeit
for 3 medium sized stars (solar depression 7.083 degrees).
Major fasts (\c
.I Yom Kippur
and
.I Tish'a B'Av\c
) begin just before sunset (at regular candle-lighting
time) and conclude at Havdalah time.
.PP
Hebcal contains a small database of cities with their
associated geographic information and time-zone information.
The geographic and time information necessary to
calculate sundown times can come to hebcal any of three
ways:
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step])
The default: the system manager sets a default city
when the program is compiled.
.br
.IP \n+[step])
Hebcal looks in the environment variable
.B HEBCAL_CITY
for the name of a city in hebcal's database, and if it
finds one, hebcal will make that the new default city.
.br
.IP \n+[step])
1 and 2 may be overridden by command line arguments, including
those specified in the
.B HEBCAL_OPTS
environment variable.
The most natural way to do this is to use the \c
.BI "\-c " "city " \c
command.  This will localize hebcal to \c
.I "city. "
A list of the cities hebcal knows about can be obtained
by typing
.nf
.sp 0.6v
	hebcal cities
.sp 0.6v
.fi
at the command prompt.  If the city you want isn't on that list, you
can directly control hebcal's geographic information with the \c
\fB\-\-geo\fP and \fB\-z\fP
switches.

.sp 0.5v
.SH DISCLAIMER
This is just a program I wrote during summer school and
while avoiding my senior project.  It should not be invested
with any sort of halachic authority.
.sp 0.5v
.SH HISTORY
.B hebcal
first appeared in
.I comp.sources.misc
on November 4, 1992.
.PP
For version 3, much of the program was rewritten using
Emacs 19's calendar routines by Edward M. Reingold and
Nachum Dershowitz.  Their program is extremely clear and
provides many instructive examples of fine calendar code in
emacs LISP.
.PP
In version 4.x (released in 2015), the sunrise/sunset
engine (used for candle-lighting times and zmanim) was
rewritten using Derick Rethans's excellent
.UR https://github.com/derickr/timelib
timelib
.UE .
.PP
Version 5.x (released 2022) was completely rewritten in Go.
.sp 0.5v
.SH BUGS
Hebrew dates are only valid before sundown on that
secular date.  An option to control this will be added
in a later release.
.PP
When specifying geographic coordinates with the
legacy \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP switches, negative longitudes are
.I east
of Greenwich.
.PP
Some combinations of options produce weird results, e.g.,
.sp 0.6v
\	hebcal -dH nisan 5744
.br
\	hebcal -dH 5744
.sp 0.6v
This comes into play when you use the
.B HEBCAL_OPTS
environment variable.
.PP
The sunup/sundown routines aren't accurate enough.  If you enter
geographic coordinates above the artic circle or below the antarctic circle,
the
times are guaranteed to be wrong.
.PP
Hebcal only translates between the Gregorian calendar
and the Jewish calendar. It does not take into account
a correction of eleven days that was introduced by Pope Gregory
XIII known as the Gregorian Reformation. Wednesday, 2 September
1752 was followed by Thursday, 14 September 1752.
.PP
This means that the results
will be at least partly useless where and when the
Gregorian calendar was not used, e.g., before
1752 in Britain and before circa 1918 in Russia.
See the Wikipedia page
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Adoption_by_country
.UE
for
a splendid chart depicting when the changeover from
the Julian to the Gregorian calendars occurred in various places.
.PP
Hebcal cannot handle date computations before 2 C.E.
